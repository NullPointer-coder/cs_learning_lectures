Dear all,
The 1st Part, Android Programming 101 is repeated, as I had introduced earlier in the previous semester --- CS430 Database System
Basically, it is not all the students in this class used to be in my CS430, previously.
The 2nd Part, is the hands-on in dealing with incoming calls in Android. (including phone numbers)
The 3rd Part, is the hands-on in reading the contacts in the Android.
The 4th Part, is the hands-on in reading the SMS in the Android.
The 5th Part, is the hands-on in sending notifications in Android.
The purpose of the 1st part is to learn the fundamental programming skills.
The 2nd, 3rd and 4th part are related to "Android Telephony".
The purpose of the 5th part is that, after a couple of "matches" from "SMS" or "incoming call numbers",
if we find "something is wrong", we need to send a "warning" to phone users.
We try to build up a simple and easy "signature based" App to detect the "unwanted calls",
as well as SPAM / SCAM text messages
